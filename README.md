It is an online escrow service that works for buyers and sellers to make safe and trustworthy trade. The smart contract acts as a middle man, not physically available but as a program. The total payment to be made by the buyer and time required by the seller to deliver the product are given as the inputs. If the seller is able to make the delivery of product in the given time, the money will get transferred into his account from buyer's account automatically.
